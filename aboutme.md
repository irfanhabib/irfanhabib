ðŸ‘‹Hi I'm your host Irfan Habib!

I'm a software engineer, hobbyist photographer, and recent dad!

With over a decade of experience as a seasoned software engineer, I leverage my skills in Big Data, Data Engineering, and Infrastructure to enable organisations to maximise their data's potential.

My work facilitates informed decision-making, boosts operational efficiency, and lays the groundwork for strategic growth. I convert raw data into valuable insights through reliable, scalable, secure and highly-available data infrastructures. Through these strategies, I help businesses thrive in the current data-centric environment.
